# NEUR 503 Computational Neuroscience Winter 2021

### DESC
Contains the lectures and assignments from the 2021 NEUR 503 Computational Neuroscience course at McGill University. The graduate proseminar class covers several modeling concepts, including decision-making, neural encoding and decoding, supervised and unsupervised learning in neural networks, generalized linear models, visual receptive fields, oculomotor plant models, consciousness analysis from EEG data, neuroelectronics, etc. in MATLAB.

Repository for course material + my assignment reports as I ran out of space in my 5 year old laptop. Assignment matlab scripts themselves are not included for obvious reasons.
